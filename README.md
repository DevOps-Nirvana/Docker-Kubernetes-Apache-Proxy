# Kubernetes Docker Apache Proxy

This simple docker image is used for proxying HTTP traffic in Kubernetes to various other endpoints.  The default docker httpd images do not have proxying enabled nor a configuration setup by default to be able to include more configs easily.  This solves that problem.

# TODO

* Add more instructions
* Add examples
* Profit?  :P
